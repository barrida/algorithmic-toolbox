Algorithm find_gas_stops()
	current position = start position;
	while (current_position < end_position)
		compute the position at which car will run out of gas.
		if (that position < end position) then
			find closest gas station before reaching that position.
			output fill up gas at that gas station.
			current position = that gas station location
		else
			current position = end position; reached
