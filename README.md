# Algorithmic Toolbox
This repository covers my submissions for [Algorithmic Toolbox Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithmic-toolbox/) by Coursera 

# About this Course
The class covers basic algorithmic techniques and ideas for computational problems arising frequently in practical applications

* sorting and searching
* divide and conquer
* greedy algorithms
* dynamic programming
* and many others.

# Topics covered
 
how to sort and search data
how to break a large problem into pieces and solve them recursively
how to pack your knapsack using greedy algorithms
how to search for similarities between genes using dynamic programming. 

You will practice solving computational problems, designing new algorithms, and implementing them as efficient software tools.
